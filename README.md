AFL-Improvement

#**Objective**#

American Fuzzy Lop Improvement is a project designed to **find security vulnerabilities** in software. Fuzzing is the idea of taking random inputs and essentially brute-forcing them to see if we crash somewhere in the program, which would expose the vulnerability. Our objective is to find a metric other than code coverage, such as nested method depth.
